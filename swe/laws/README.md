## [Beyoncé Rule](beyonce-rule)

> "If a product experiences outages or other problems as a result of infrastructure changes, but the issue wasn't surfaced by tests in our *Continuous Integration* (CI) system, it is not the fault of the infrastructure change." More colloquially, this is phrased as *"If you liked it, you should have put a CI test on it".*

## [Churn Rule](churn-rule)

> "Infrastructure teams must do the work to move their internal users to new versions themselves or do the update in place, in backward-compatible fashion."

## Conway's law

> Any organization that desings a system... will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure. - *Melvin Conway, How Do Committees Invent?*

## [Hyrum's Law: The Law of Implicit Dependencies](hyrum)

> "With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody."

## Constantine's law

> A structure is stable if *cohesion* is high, and *coupling* is low. - *Larry Constantine*.
