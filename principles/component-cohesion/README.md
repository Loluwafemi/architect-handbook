## Cohesion

Today we have a much more complex variety of cohesion that a module performs one, and only one, function.

In choosing the classes to group together into components, we must consider the opposing forces involved in reusability and develop-ability. Balancing these forces with the needs of the application is nontrivial. Moreover, the balance is almost always dynamic.
