## Definition

General REsponsibility Assignment Software Patterns/Principles is a set of nine fundamental principles in object design.

First published by Craig Larman in his 1997 book _Applying UML and Patterns_.

> "The critical design tool for software development is a mind well educated in design principles. It is not UML or any other technology. Thus, the GRASP principles are really a mental toolset, a learning aid to help in the design of objectoriented software." - Craig Larman.
