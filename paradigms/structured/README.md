# Structured Programming

> Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.

The first paradigm to be adopted (but not the first to be invented) was structured programming, which was discovered by _Edsger Sybe Dijkstra_ in __1968__.  Dijkstra showed that the use of unrestrained jumps (`goto` statements) is harmful to program structure. He replaced those jumps with the more familiar `if`/`then`/`else`  and `do`/`while`/`until` constructs.
