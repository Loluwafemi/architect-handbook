# Object Oriented Programming

Programming paradigm based on the concept of _objects_, which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as _attributes_ or _properties_), and code in the form of procedures (often known as _methods_).

Object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects often have a notion of `this` or `self`).

OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are _class-based_, meaning that objects are _instances of classes_, which also determine their types. Many of the most widely used programming languages are _multi-paradigm_ and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with Imperative and Procedural programming.
