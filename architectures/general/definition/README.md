# Software Architecture

The obvious appeal of architecture is __structure__ (components, classes, functions, modules, layers, and services, micro or macro).

> _Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change._ - Grady Booch

This measure tells us how we can determine whether an architecture is good or not: Not only does a good architecture meet the needs of its users, developers, and owners at a given point in time, but it also meets them over time.

> _If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture._ - Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder

This throws some light on the problem software architecture tries to solve. How to know what typical changes will be so that we can shape the system through _significant design decisions_ around them? How do we reduce future development effort and cost? 

> _Architecture is a hypothesis, that needs to be proven by implementation and measurement._ - Tom Gilb

Good software architecture __recognizes the softness__ of software and __aims to preserve it__ as a first-class property of the system. It recognizes that we operate with incomplete knowledge, but it also understands that, as humans, operating with incomplete knowledge is something we can do through experimentation and discovery. A good architecture comes form understanding it more as a journey than as a destination, more as an __ongoing process of enquiry than as a frozen artifact__.
