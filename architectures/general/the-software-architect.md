## Quotes

### Simon Brown

It's about designing software and solving problems within a specific organizational context, and being aware of what's happening around you, so that you can successfully navigate and influence that context where necessary.

> Architects need to communicate and influence at different levels, with different audiences, both inside and outside of their immediate team environment.

Avoid the "business versus IT" mindset. Learn how to see the bigger picture to map and influence the organizational landscape, how to deal with vendors, and how to communicate across all levels of an organization.

### David Knott

> Riding the architecture elevator is how my team and I spend our time.

Racing from one part of our organization to another, connecting, explaining questioning, and trying to make good decisions about complex systems with imperfect information. The elevator takes us from code to business strategy and back again, all within the same day.

> If you're not taking meaningful decisions, making them explicit, and helping people understand them, you're not doing architecture.
