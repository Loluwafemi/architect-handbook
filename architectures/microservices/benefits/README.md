# Microservices Benefits

* __Modularity__: Application is easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion. This benefit is often argued in comparision to the complexity of monolithic architectures.

* __Scalability__: Since microservices are implemented and deployed independently of each other, i.e. they run within independent processes, they can be monitored and scaled independently.

* __Integration of heterogeneous and legacy systems__: Microservices is considered as a viable means for modernizing existing monolithic applications, by replacing parts of the existing software using an *incremental approach*.

* __Distributed development__: It parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It facilitates *continuous integratio, delivery and deployment*.
