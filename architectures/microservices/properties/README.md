# Microservices Properties

## Overall Characteristics

There is no single definition for microservices. A consensus view has evolved over time in the industry. Some of the defining characteristics that are frequently cited include:

* Services in a microservice architecture (MSA) are often processes that communicate over a network to fulfil a goal using technology-agnostic protocols such as HTTP.

* Services are organized around business capabilities.

* Services can be implemented using different programming languages, databases, hardware and software environment, depending on what fits best.

* Services are small in size, messaging-enabled, bounded by contexts, autonomously developed, independently deployable, decentralized and built and released with automated processes.

## Martin Folwer Properties

Martin Fowler descries a microservices-based architecture as having following properties:

* Lends itself to a continuous delivery software development process. A change to a small part of the application only requires rebuilding and redeploying only one or a small number of services.

* Adheres to principles such as fine-grained interfaces (to independently deployable services), business-driven development (e.g. *domain-driven design*).
