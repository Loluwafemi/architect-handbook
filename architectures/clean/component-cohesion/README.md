# Component Cohesion

If the Design Principles, such as SOLID, tell us how to arrange the bricks into walls and rooms, then the component principles tell us how to arrange the rooms into buildings.

Cohesion is a measure of the degree to which the elements of the module are functionally related. 

It is the degree to which all elements directed towards performing a single task are contained in the component. Basically, cohesion is the internal glue that keeps the module together.

A good software design will have high cohesion.

Large software systems, like large buildings, are build out of smaller components.
