# Considerations for Better Architecture

We seek to have the following aspects covered in our Node Architecture:

* Type Safety (TypeScript)
* Separation of Concern
* Feature Encapsulation
* Error Handling
* Response Handling
* Promise Management
* Robust Unit Tests
* Simple Deployability
* Don't Use Unified Front-Back Codebase
* Backend Independent from any Frontend
